# HyperskillHacktoberfest

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest! The goal of this repo is to provide all Hyperskill users a way to participate in Hacktoberfest.
I would like for all learners to be able to participate in this project without having to worry about the material being too advanced. 
If you have any ideas or suggestions on how I could make it more accessible for you, feel free to contact me on discord at Copyright#0169 or through the JetBrains Academy discord: https://discord.gg/agAx7z

Make sure you are signed up for the event or your progress won't count! https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/
